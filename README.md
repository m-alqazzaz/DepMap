# DepMap
RNA Expression and Gene Dependency Analysis to Select Cell Lines for CRISPR KO
Code is written to determine RNA expression of genes 
Multiple data transformation steps for data downloaded from depmap were needed to run the code
Most recent depmap data were downloaded from https://depmap.org/portal/download/all/?releasename=DepMap+Public+23Q2&filename=Model.csv
Cut off for RNA expression is Log2TMP+1>3 but can be chagned in the For loop
